# Industry Experience

Much of my spare time goes into developing my skills and knowledge in the Strategy, User-Experience (UX) and Technology, which goes hand-in-hand with my current role as Technical Lead and Senior developer. Having worked with so many businesses over the years, as well having run my own successful ecommerce business generating almost one million pounds turnover, I have real-world knowledge and experience of developing, marketing and day-to-day running of digitally foccused businesses.

Both user-centric design and business logic are really important to me and I have more recently run very successful UX and strategy workshops for SME and largeer companies such as The Ritz Club london.

Having hands-on knowledge of multiple language, platforms and ecommerce gives me invaluable experience which can be applied to projects I manage.
