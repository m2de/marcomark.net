The first version of the app was actually created in Java, natively for Android OS. I later wrote a completely new version in LUA using the Corona Labs SDK, allowing me to build the mobile app for both iOS and Android using the same codebase. The free version featured mobile Ads from my own ad management platform, essentially just cross-promoting all my apps and the paid version removed ads and offered a number of additional features.
