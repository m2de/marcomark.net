# Migrating from Laravel (PHP) to Nest.js (Node)

tldr; I am documenting my journey from Laravel developer to Node developer.

For the last 5+ years I have been using Laravel for all my backend work.
I love Laravel, it is an awesome framework with a large ecosystem surrounding it.
At the same time, I have been working with Vue and Nuxt as well as React and Next for all my frontend work, and more recently almost exclusively with Typescript.
Jumping between the two, Laravel (PHP) and Node (Typescript) is starting to feel like a big swith in context and not the most efficient way of working, which is why I have decided to take the leap to go full stack Javascript / Typescript.
